Grammy-nominated for Best Dance/Electronic Album. Their demo is 22-35 affluent millennials/Gen Z who pay premium prices for experiences. The Gorge 2-night opener, Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and MSG are all bucket-list venue plays. Bonnaroo headlining slot adds festival cachet.

Their lottery system means most fans DON'T get tickets at face, creating guaranteed secondary demand. 5 nights at MSG (shows #92-96) is a milestone run teeing up show #100 for NYE 2026 — Phish heads will pay anything for these. Return to Fenway Park for first time since 2019 adds scarcity nostalgia. Dick's Labor Day weekend is annual tradition with travel package demand. TWO UPGRADED TARGETS: (1) Savannah is the FIRST-EVER Phish show in the city AND only 9,500 cap at Enmarket Arena — the smallest venue on the entire summer tour by a wide margin. Destination city appeal (historic district, beach-adjacent, great food) creates a vacation-show hybrid that drives the same 'destination phan' energy as Riviera Maya or the Gorge. Best pure flip opportunity on the tour on a margin-per-ticket basis. (2) Madison WI is the TOUR OPENER at Kohl Center after a 28-YEAR absence (last played 1998 — the legendary 'naked guy' show). Opening night always debuts new material and gets extra energy. Midwest phans from Chicago/Milwaukee/Twin Cities have been starved for a non-festival Phish show. Local news coverage (Spectrum News, WMTV, UW Athletics) already amplifying beyond the usual phan base. Phantasy Tour threads speculating on Madison return since Dec 2025 = pent-up demand confirmed. The Phish secondary market is its own ecosystem — phans trade on CashOrTrade but mainstream demand flows through StubHub/Vivid where premiums are 1.5-3x.
